## Racing Driver

On the Raspberry Pi we are using the Pololu MC33926 Dual Motor Driver head. It comes with a library and a python example.
This documentation shows how to use the shield: https://github.com/pololu/dual-mc33926-motor-driver-rpi/blob/master/example.py

The program I used is in
racing_driver

## Arduino Software 

In order to get the readings from the light barriers, I'm using an Arduino with an LCD. The code can be found in
